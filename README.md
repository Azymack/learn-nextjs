In this course repo we will learn Web 2.0 cloud development using the latest state of the art stack. Using this stack you will be able to develop SaaS applications that scale instantly to support even the most demanding applications, while at the same time delivering up to 90% cost savings. This stack is ideal for a broad set of applications. For example, enterprises that have hundreds of thousands of applications, or software as a service (SaaS) vendors that have multi-tenant environments with hundreds or thousands of databases, can use this stack across the entire enterprise. This stack also provides the foundations for developing Web 3.0 applications and Metaverse experiences.

The Web 2.0 full stack applicatios are build using these technologies:

1. [Typescript Programming Language for Front-end and Backend Development](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [Front-end Web 2.0 Development Using Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
4. [Infrastructure as Code using AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
5. [AWS Lambda for Serverless Computing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
6. [Panacloud CLI for API Development](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@panacloud/cli)
7. [Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL 13-compatible edition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html)


This Web 2.0 stack can be easily extended to develop Web 3.0 Dapps using these technologies:

The Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 stacks can easily be extended to develop Metaverse experiences. The backend will remain more less the same, the front-end will move towards 3D from 2D:

2. [C# for Unity XR Programming](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html)
